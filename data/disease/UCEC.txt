hsa-mir-200b	35749917	OBJECTIVE: In this study, we focused on five microRNAs (miRNAs) that have been reported to regulate phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) gene expression, namely miR-182, miR-183, miR-200a, miR-200b, and miR-205, and examined their relationships with PTEN protein expression in endometrial cancer tissues. CONCLUSION: Using endometrial cancer tissues, we found for the first time that miR-182, miR-183, miR-200a, and miR-200b were strongly correlated with each other, whereas miR-205 was not strongly correlated with the other four miRNAs.
