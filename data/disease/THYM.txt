hsa-mir-542	33277874	METHODS: We identified a series of non-coding (nc) RNAs (including BCL11A, miR-3977, miR-4460 and miR3p) and TF (FAM185A, MGAM2, SEC14L4, ACTBL2), and predicted transcription factors (including AHR, ATF4, CEBPA and DDIT3) that have significant regulatory effects on the module by difference analysis, co-expression analysis, enrichment analysis of thymoma gene expression profiling and using hypergeometric test to calculate the potential regulatory effects of multiple factors on the module.	Unknown

hsa-mir-124	33464097	AST-IV improves tibial defects in rats and promotes proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs through the miR3p.1/STAT3 axis.	Unknown
hsa-mir-27a	32067269	We demonstrated that CUR blocked mTOR and Notch 1 pathways via downregulating miR-27a, thereby suppressing cell growth, migration, and invasion of thymic carcinoma cells.	Unknown
hsa-mir-525	33907842	In summary, this study demonstrates that LOXL1AS1 acts as a sponge that targets miR5255p to promote HSPA9 expression, thereby promoting the growth and invasion and inhibiting apoptosis of thymoma and thymic carcinoma cells.	Unknown
