hsa-mir-1307	34541347	We evaluated the expression levels of miR3p in sera obtained from 254 patients with thirteen types of cancer (colon cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer esophageal cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, biliary tract cancer, brain cancer, sarcoma) and 27 non-cancer samples using isothermal amplification and microRNA chip.	Unknown
hsa-mir-379	33436720	Differentially methylated regions and genes were detected, not been previously implicated in sarcoma progression, including at PTPRN2 and DAXX in LMS, WT1-AS and TNXB in SS, VENTX and NTRK3 in pleomorphic RMS and MEST and the C14MC / miR-379/miR-656 in MFS.	Unknown
hsa-mir-671	36016604	The results showed that miR-671 rs1870238 GC CC (OR = 1.963, 95% CI = 1.258-3.064, P = 0.003) and miR-671 rs2446065 CG GG (OR =1.838, 95% CI = 1.178-2.868, P = 0.007) may be genetic risk factors for STSs after adjustment for age and smoking. Therefore, this study suggests that individuals carrying the GC CC genotype for miR-671 rs1870238 or the CG GG genotype for miR-671 rs2446065 are susceptible to STSs.	Unknown
